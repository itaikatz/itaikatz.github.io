Visualizing Digital Elevation Maps
==

In this post we'll demonstrate how to convert a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) into a visualization suitable for use in a website or other application. A DEM is simply a 3D representation of a terrain's surface. Typically these are used for mapping the Earth's surface, but the same principle applies to mapping the Moon, other planets, or even microscopic surfaces. You may have encountered a similar concept in computer graphics, where it's referred to as a heightmap. 

Here's what a DEM of the earth looks like. White regions represent higher elevation. Note the prominence of the Rockies, Andes, and Himalayan mountain ranges:

Applications

For this example we'll use a DEM to create a topographic map of Costa Rica. Costa Rica is an especially interesting example as it contains a variety of surface features ranging from relatively flat plains to prominent mountain ranges.
