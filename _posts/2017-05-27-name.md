What can you discover about a person from just their first name? With the right data set, it turns out, quite a bit. While they might seem randomly distributed, a person's name says a lot about them: where they are from, their generation, and other demographic details. This has many practical uses but for now let's start by taking a look at the raw data.

### Diving into the name database

The Social Security Administration maintains a [database of baby names](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html) for each year going back to 1880 along with their rankings. Here are the most popular baby names for 2016:

| Rank | Male      | Female      |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1    | Noah      | Emma        |
| 2    | Liam      | Olivia      |
| 3    | William   | Ava         |
| 4    | Mason     | Sophia      |
| 5    | James     | Isabella    |
| 6    | Benjamin  | Mia         |
| 7    | Jacob     | Charlotte   |
| 8    | Michael   | Abigail     |
| 9    | Elijah    | Emily       |
| 10   | Ethan     | Harper      |

Looking at this chart you may get an intuitive sense that some of these names are older than others. You may know Williams of all different ages, but Mason "feels" like a recent trend. Similarly for girls, Emma feels like it has a longer history than Harper. Looking at the prevalence over time shows this to be true. Here are those names, along with a few others:

<div class="row" id="male-single"></div>
<br/>
<div class="row" id="female-single"></div>
<br/>
Clearly, the evolution of a particular name over time is highly variable. By graphing names over time this way we can quickly gather insights at a glance. Some names, like William, were once staggeringly common (at one point nearly 10% of the male population!) but have lost popularity over time. Emma is, at the time of this writing, the most common girls' name, despite having gone nearly extinct in the 1970s. An interesting anomaly from this analysis is the tendency for some names to come about seemingly spontaneously. Often these are "invented" names from popular media.

Pop culture and historical events
---

The name "Samantha" was created in 1964 for Elizabeth Montgomery's character in the TV series Bewitched. It was so chosen because it sounded particularly "witchy" to contemporary audiences. At the time, "Samantha" was in the same league as her supporting characters "Endora", "Tabitha", and "Esmerelda" (although those never caught on!).

			<figcaption>The first Samantha (1964) </figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>

"Madison" was chosen by Daryl Hannah's character in the film Splash, after the eponymous street in New York City. "Madison's not a name!", Tom Hanks' character exclaims in the movie. Today it is one of the most popular girls' names and Tom Hanks' comment may be confusing to modern viewers.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-12"> <div class="names-chart" id="madison"></div> </div>

  <iframe id="madison-video" class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8CRERCoC10"></iframe>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Just as media or current events can spontaneously create names, they can also lead to their extinction. While "Katrina" had been already been in decline for the past few decades, the 2005 hurricane led to the name being stigmatized. Even more dramatically, "Isis" enjoyed moderate success (about 500 girls per year) throughout much of the 2000s. Due to its association with the less-than-felicitous terrorist group, by 2016 only 53 girls were born with that name. I'm somewhat surprised that there are even 53 baby Isises out there, proving once again that people are delightfully complex.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6"> <div class="names-chart" id="katrina"></div> </div>
<div class="col-6"> <div class="names-chart" id="isis"></div> </div>
</div>
<br/>

While most names are exclusively male or female, some are androgynous (a phenonemon exploited to great effect with Saturday Night Live's ["It's Pat!"](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/its-pat/n10133?snl=1) series of skits). Occasionally a name will even flip genders as in Leslie or Rory, the latter corresponding to the success of the television series "Gilmore Girls":

<div class="row" id="male-female"></div>
<br/>

A practical application: Classifying names by gender
---

Looking at these plots, you may get the sense that they simply confirm what you already knew about a name. It may be obvious to you that Mary is a woman's name or that Clarence was more popular in the 1800s. Where the data really shines though is in resolving ambiguous examples. Suppose you got an email from a person named Jaime. Is Jaime a man or a woman? Let's compare it to the seemingly equivalent name Jamie:

<div class="row" id="jaime-jamie"></div>
<br>
While these two names are spelled and sound similar, these graphs show that _Jaime_ is probably male while _Jamie_ is probably female. We can use this same intuition to estimate the male/female probabilty for any name. However, what if we had a huge dataset, with hundreds of thousands of names? Manually classifying them all would be very tedius!

Instead, imagine using a data-driven approach to create an automated gender classifier. To do this we'll leverage a tool from statistics known as **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**. You click the box below to read more details, or skip ahead to see the results.

The chart below shows the popularity of a few names, separated by male and female. While a few names are almost exclusively unisex, most names are at least partially given to both genders.

<div class="col-10 mx-auto" id="gender-ratio-chart"></div>

<br>

By applying the maximum likelihood estimator, we can get a single number that predicts if a given name is male or female:

<div class="col-10 mx-auto" id="classifier-chart"></div>
<br>

In a future blog post we'll apply our new classifier to analyze the federal salary dataset. 
Since the dataset includes names, but no genders, we'll use our classifier to split the dataset into male and female employees and generate some interesting statistics to compare the two.

#### Investigating the gender wage gap in federal salaries

In recent years there's been increased debate on wage desparities between men and women. Reports vary, but it's commonly asserted that women make 75-80% of men for the same work (i.e. adjusted for number of hours worked). Typically these reports are produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and are based on all jobs in the US. These numbers are difficult to verify though, since most employers don't disclose salary data at the level of individual employees. 

There is one notable exception: the federal government. Since 1816, the government has [publicly released salary data](https://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/) on all employees, including their names and departments. So we know for example the president in 1816, James Monroe, earned $25,000/yr (an office clerk that same year made $1,000). 

Here's what a snippet of the database looks like:

<div class="row"> <div class="col-12">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/names/federal_salary.png" style="width: 100%">
</div></div>

As you might notice from the table above, the names are listed but the genders are not. If we wanted to analyze salaries of men versus women, we could add manual annotations to each employee record. However with over two million entries that would be extremely tedius. A better approach would be to use our name database to automatically estimate the likelihood of a name being male or female, as we did with the Jaime/Jamie example above.

Applying this system to all employee records produces the following result:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6"> <div id="fed-salary-chart"></div> </div>
<div class="col-6"> <div id="fed-count-chart"></div> </div>
</div>

[edit]
Observations: 
Within each pay grade, salaries are nearly identical. However, women dominate the mid-range pay grades (GS-05 through GS-12) and men dominate the high ranges (GS-14 and GS-15). Does this indicate a wage gap? It depends on the interpretation. If you assume that pay grades are rough proxies for the type of job, then the per-grade wage gap is essentially zero. However, if you consider the aggregate of all positions (and that men dominate the higher pay ranges), the result is a wage gap of approximately 10.4%.

So when all the occupations are averaged together, men are paid slightly more in the federal government than women. Can we get more specific and compare salaries for within each occupation? This would give a more accurate comparison of _like_ work. Luckily the data lists occupations as well. Here is the salary breakdown for a few popular ones:
