		<p>This tool helps users explore how names change in popularity over time and geographic regions. To start, enter a name and select male/female (if applicable). Below, youâ€™ll see four charts: </p>
        <ol>
		<li><b>Prevalence (national)</b>: Percentage of babies born <span style="font-style:italic">per year</span> with the selected name</li>
		<li><b>Age</b>: Number of individuals at each age</li>
		<li><b>Prevalence (per state)</b>: Percentage of babies born <span style="font-style:italic">per state</span> with the selected name</li>
		<li><b>Ranking</b>: Relative rank of the selected name amongst the top 1000</li>
		</ol>
		Try hovering over (or tapping on) the charts for more information. Note: for performance reasons, only the top 1000 male and female names are in the database.

[In a previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/posts/name.html) I analyzed the Social Security Administration's (SSA) name dataset to determine what infomation could be obtained from just a person's first name. It was interesting to discover examples of how pop culture and historical events shaped the evolution of particular names. In this follow-up I expanded that post into an interactive application. Type in a name to get started. The four panels illustrate how the submitted name's popularity compares over time, geographic region, and to other names. Tap on the help button for more information.

### How does it work?

The application combines three datasets:
<ol>
	<li>The original name dataset referenced in the previous blog post. This data lists the number of individuals born with any given name, for the years 1910-2020.</li>
	<li>An expanded dataset that breaks down the first dataset by state.</li>
	<li>US actuarial tables, from which I derived survival curves. This let me compute the number of individuals alive with a given name from any birth year (for the 'Age' panel)</li>
</ol>

### Observations

One interesting outcome we can derive is the most _prominent_ name for each state. If we were to look at the most popular names for each state, they would likely all be similar (in recent years: 'Noah' and 'Emma'). In contrast, prominence looks at how unique a name is for a given state, irrespective of its overall popularity. You can think of a state's most prominent name as the one that best distinguishes it from the rest of the country.

<div class="text-center">
  <h3>Most Prominent Name (Per State)</h3>
</div>

<div class="row my-4">
<div class="col-6 col-md-3">
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>State</th>
		<th>Male</th>
		<th>Female</th>
	</tr>
	{% for val in site.data.names.prominence limit:13 %}
	<tr>
		<td>{{val.state}}</td>
		<td>{{val.male | capitalize}}</td>
		<td>{{val.female | capitalize}}</td>
	</tr>
	{% endfor %}
</table>
</div>
<div class="col-6 col-md-3">
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>State</th>
		<th>Male</th>
		<th>Female</th>
	</tr>
	{% for val in site.data.names.prominence limit:13 offset:13 %}
	<tr>
		<td>{{val.state}}</td>
		<td>{{val.male | capitalize}}</td>
		<td>{{val.female | capitalize}}</td>
	</tr>
	{% endfor %}
</table>
</div>
<div class="col-6 col-md-3">
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>State</th>
		<th>Male</th>
		<th>Female</th>
	</tr>
	{% for val in site.data.names.prominence limit:13 offset:26 %}
	<tr>
		<td>{{val.state}}</td>
		<td>{{val.male | capitalize}}</td>
		<td>{{val.female | capitalize}}</td>
	</tr>
	{% endfor %}
</table>
</div>
<div class="col-6 col-md-3 order-md-1">
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>State</th>
		<th>Male</th>
		<th>Female</th>
	</tr>
	{% for val in site.data.names.prominence offset:39 %}
	<tr>
		<td>{{val.state}}</td>
		<td>{{val.male | capitalize}}</td>
		<td>{{val.female | capitalize}}</td>
	</tr>
	{% endfor %}
</table>

</div>
</div>

Some of these promiment names relate to a state's natural environment, such as 'Aspen' in Colorado, or 'Orion' and 'Aurora' in Alaska. Others prominences are associated with a state's demographics: New York has 'Chaim' and 'Chaya' oweing to their large Orthodox Jewish population. Similarly, Michigan ('Hassan') and Texas ('Santos') have names corresponding to their Muslim and Hispanic populations, respectively.

### Limitations

<ul>
	<li> Only the top 1000 male and female names (as measured from 2000-2020) are considered due to performance constraints. As this website is being served statically, keeping download sizes small were a challenge in developing this application. For comparison, there are approximately 250,000 unique names in the name database, half of which have fewer than five individuals.</li>
	<li> As the names come from the SSA, the dataset only covers names of individuals born in the US</li>
	<li> For privacy reasons, any names with fewer than five individuals in a given year are omitted. This means that if you have a particularly obscure name, you might not see any births registered in your birth year (assuming it's in the dataset at all)</li>
</ul>
