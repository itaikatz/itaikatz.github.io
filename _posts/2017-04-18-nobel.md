You can still win a Nobel Prize
==

[post in progress!] 

A few years ago I came across a quote attributed to the reknowned physicist (and Nobel laureate) Albert Einstein. Unlike many quotes [misattributed to him](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Misattributed){:target="_blank"}, this one was genuine. What I found most striking was its pessimistic tone: 

> A person who has not made his great contribution to science before the age of thirty will never do so" 
> 
> <span style="font-size: 1rem">&mdash; Albert Einstein</span>

Being a scientist myself this didn't seem quite right. Acquiring sufficient knowledge to make an impact takes years (or perhaps decades) of experience. I'm not sure when Einstein made this remark, but my guess is that it was shortly after his _annus mirabilis_ ("miracle year") where, at the age of 26, he published a series of four papers that changed the foundations of modern physics. Yet despite his early success, Einstein continued to produce influential work throughout his life.

So does a scientist's productive years have an expiration date? Rather than going by intuition I turned to data on Nobel laureates compiled by the [National Bureau of Economic Research](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/47/18910).
