<h1> Company </h1>

Lacuna Labs was founded in 2015 by a pair of computer vision scientists to develop breakthrough technologies in image processing, scene analysis, and data visualization. While the field of computer vision is vast, it has until recently been confined to laboratory prototypes. With the development of new technologies and the ubiquity of cameras this is beginning to change. Lacuna Labs proprietary algorithms and powerful software tools put computer vision in the hands of non-technical users. The company is headquartered in Bethesda, MD.
