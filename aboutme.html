<div class="about-text">
<p> I'm a researcher studying robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. As a child I was captivated by visions of sci-fi utopias. Today am privileged to live in a time where many of these technologies are coming to fruition.</p>

<p>My primary research interest is in autonomous robotics; in the past I've worked on autonomous ground and underwater vehicles as well as more niche applications like robotic construction and interplanetary exploration. Along the way I've collaborated with a number of labs including those at Stanford University, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the University of Maryland, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  </p>
