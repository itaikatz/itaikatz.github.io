Objective
---
To establish a research institute to advance adoption and awareness of computer vision technologies.

<div class="large-8 columns" markdown="1">

There exists a distinct gap in the computer vision (CV) landscape: despite having a dominant presence in research for the past 30 years, adoption by the commercial sector has been slow. Only in the past few years have consumer applications been brought to the market (e.g. face recognition in photography, hand-written digit recognition for check processing). Public awareness of CV similarly lags behind the state of the art[^imagenet].

We propose an institute to match academic research in CV with novel commercial applications, taking technologies that are at TRL[^trl] 3-4 and developing them to TRL 7-8 (see Fig. 1). Activities will include:

* Providing consulting services in emerging CV markets
* Building tools to lower barriers to entry for image/video analysis
* Attending conferences and other events of academic interest
* Educational outreach through blogs, discussions, etc.

### Revenue model
- individual projects for specific trials
- CRADAs with large companies (Northrop Grumman, TASER Intl., etc.)

### Revenue goal
- $200k/yr within 6 months (approx 120hrs/mo @ $150/hr)

### First steps:

### Footnotes
* [^imagenet]: Recent advancements in Deep Learning have resulted in dramatic improvements in object recognition, as measured by the annual [ImageNet](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/533761/best-of-2014-the-revolutionary-technique-that-quietly-changed-machine-vision-forever/) competition. In some cases, category classification exceeds human capabilities (e.g. determining dog breeds).
